            <h2>
                my most recent trip was going to San Fransisco, by a cruise ship, whith my brother, my uncle, and my cousin
            <h2>
             <p>
                the trip started off with my Grandpa driving all 4 of us to the port, we went through security and got our medalions, which were little tags that served as keys
                for the room, and it served as a tracker if one of us were to get lost. on the ship, we sat down in the room before going outside to see the sea and notice that
                we already past the bridge which my mother told me to take a picture of before we left. we were then off to the 17th floor to register for the kid's club area 
                so we can go there and play games or something if we feel bored, we went exploring the ship until 1700 hrs to make it to floor 6 so we could get there in time 
                for the dinner reservation. the first dinner I had fried chicken, after dinner winston and I went to the beach house (the 13-17 side of the kids club) to go play air hockey
                and fooseball, within the first 10 mins we were roped into a game organised by the person who runs the place on the beach house in which we were answering riddles 
                I ended up getting all the riddles but the ones which were assigned to me, which were all puns and jokes, not proper riddles.
            </p>
            <p>
                on the second day, I woke up early for no reason so I spent an hour or 2 sitting in the dark until I woke up winston and bianca because it was already day time out,
                we began talking about how the boat was shaking out at sea, when we got up for breakfast at the buffet which was open for a few hours, and before we got to sit down and 
                eat, winston started feeling seasick to the point where he would not eat his breakfast, that evening after winston got over his sea sickness we headed for the top deck to play
                mini golf and basketball 
            </p>
            <p>
                the next morning I woke up with nothing to do so I slept in for a while, had breakfast, watched a movie on the tv in the room and pretty much did nothing the whole day,
                next morning I woke up at 4 am to go see the bridge we were passing under, because when we started the trip I forgot to take a picture of the other bridge.
            </p>

            <p style="padding-top: 50%;">
                after I went back down to the room and waited until everyone woke up, then we had breakfast at the buffet, then we left the ship into San Fransisco Harbor, where it took under 
                30 seconds to find an american flag. after about 10 mins of walking we saw a self driving car and took it to see some statues and a prison island called alcatraz which is the 
                background image for this page.

            <img src="images/america/san fransisco/road.jpg" id="road">
            <p style="padding-top: 500px;">
                we saw a very steep, very famous road, which I cannot recall off the top of my head. we saw some hollow parts in the roads and we saw a carriage of sorts being pulled by cables under the street 
                after a bit of walking we saw a museum where the cable cars operate from, we saw the large wheels that they use to pull the steel rope under the streets, the one that pulls the cars.

            <p style="padding-top: 450px;">
                after we finished we went to the airport and flew back home, it was probably my first time having a short flight of about 3-4 hours, we got home at about 10 pm and that is the ended
                of my trip in San Fransisco
