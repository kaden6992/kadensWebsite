            <h3>
                my first and currently only trip to europe was to france and england, with me, my mother, brother and grandmother.
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                the plane ride was uneventful, except for the aurora borealis in the sky, we landed in the morning and went to the hotel, where my grandmother was waiting. She had already been in france 
                for a few days and had a one person hotel room, where we stayed there for half an hour before walking over to the other hotel where we were to stay for the next 3 nights. We were on the 
                top floor, and took the abnormaly slow elavator down to the main floor. we got lunch at a deli shop, and went to the eiffel tower.

                    the eiffel tower is incredibly large, when I thought I was right next to it, we kept walking for another 15 mins. when we eventually arrived at the tower, we waited in line for a bit to go up the tower.

                    we got back down and back to the hotel; before <br>we realised it was still midday, thus deciding<br> to go to the catacombs that night. the catacombs <br>were cool and I had been wanting to go since<br> I was told of
                    the trip, and wanted to go<br> to the catacombs before that even.

                the catacombs are a mass grave from the plague, where all the bodies in<br> the graveyard were overflowing, so the authorities decided to use the<br> old limestone quarry to host all the bodies, where they cant
                be touched<br> by robbers or unsuspecting civillians who might get the plague <br>from residual viruses. the catacombs are an amazing<br> structure and I had always wanted to visit it, I even got a T-shirt

                next day we got breakfast/lunch from the same deli shop place before going into the louvre to see the mona lisa, where the line was so long it left the area somehow, we ended up finding another entrance
                instead <br>of waiting for the rest of the day, since Grandma had a cane with her, french and english people really like to give preferential treatment to elderly people with canes for some reason, so we not only
                completley <br>skipped the line for the mona lisa, we got to go in the area in front of it where nobody was allowed to go to. we spent the rest of the day going to different art galleries, like some lilypads place.<br>
                we went to napoleons tomb at around 1700 hrs, I got another T-shirt here, we walked around for a while inside the grand building, before going over to the arc de triumph, which we also skipped<br> the line on
                because of Grandma, we stayed up on the top for a while to see the eiffel tower light up.

              <p>
                next morning we went to the cafe next to the hotel for breakfast, before seeing some old buildings in the general location. at around 1300 - 1400 hrs we made our way to the train station, where we
                waited for a while before getting on the train to england. when we arrived there it was already night, so we got to the hotel and went to bed.<br><br><br><br><br> the next morning we ate at the 
                free buffet area, then going to an old castle for a tour. the castle once had an actual moat, but it was drained and had some rubbish in it. an hour after the tour, we went by double decker red buses
                to the british museum, where we saw carvings, the rosetta stone, and old stuff like that. after the british museum, we went to my personal favourite part of the trip, the natural history museum, it had
                a whale skeleton in the main lobby, as well as a mamoth skeleton, the museum had a lot of cool stuff that winston didnt find interesting at all, the only bad part was that the part I wanted to go the 
                most was closed for cleaning or something. we went for dinner and walked back to the hotel soon after.

            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
              Next morning we got up early for breakfast again, before calling an hour<br> long uber to go to a harry potter exhibit/museum thing
              we spent most of the day there. the harry potter musuem had a giant model ukrainian <br>ironbelly dragon in the entrance/exit, there was a massive building of gringotts bank, the cafe area sold 
              "butterbeer," which was<br> just some soda that tasted like it wasnt soda, an area built to look like diagon alley, an area made to look like the forbidden forest, the place was massive.<br> the gift shop 
              sold merch, like wands and hogwarts bags and stuff, including bertie bot's every flavour beans, which we got.

            <p>
              after spending most of our day at the harry potter exhibit, we went back to the city to go for high-tea at a fancy restaurant. the bathrooms there were high quality and clean, so we stole some expensive looking paper towels
              the food came in multiple courses, apetizers, scones, and desert. the tea was high quality, I even drank three pots, the apetizers were little sandwich looking things and stuff, the scones were really good, they were warm, and soft, and the jam and 
              cream that they supplied us with were equally amazing. The deserts were what we were actually there for, we got the art desert package, which was four little deserts that are modeled after famous modern art pieces
              such as Banksy's balloon, some abstract art pieces and one looked like a regular desert.

            <p>
              the last day we were in london, we walked around seeing some parks, then because it was raining, we went to seek shelter at a winston churchill museum, which took the rest of the day.
